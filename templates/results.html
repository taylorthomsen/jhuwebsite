	<p><b>From the <a href="https://www.quandl.com/data/GALLUP/GUNS1-United-States-Household-Gun-Ownership">United States Household Gun Ownership</a> dataset, we can see the yearly trend in the number of American households that contain a gun from 1960-2012. 
	</b></p>

	<p>The graph shows a general downward trend in gun ownership since a spike in ownership in 1994. However, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/05/gun-sales-hit-new-record-ahead-of-new-obama-gun-restrictions/">FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System</a> reports that gun sales have been increasing in recent years with an all time high for gun sales recorded in 2015. It is likely that gun sales have increased while the number of households with guns have decreased because gun owners have been purchasing more guns in addition to the ones they already own. This chart doesn't right out answer my research question, but it is important to get a grasp of gun onwership trends in America.</p>

	<p><b>The scatter plots below compare the different gun ownership and homocide variables measured in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1chqUZHuY6cXYrRYkuE0uwXisGaYvr7durZHJhpLGycs/edit#gid=0">Small Arms Survey</a>.
	</b></p>

	<p>After studying the scatter plots it is evident that some countries with higher firearm rates also had higher homicide rates; however, the pattern is not consistent across all countries. In general, the scatter plots show no association between gun ownership and homocide across countries in the year 2007. Going forward it would be useful to identify more datasets on gun ownership and homocide that are specfic to a single country over time to see if gun ownership and homicide are associated within one country.
